## Hello!

Associate professor at the Institute of Computing of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. Former postdoctoral researcher at UNICAMP and assistant researcher at the Public Research Centre Henri Tudor, Luxembourg. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science (2014) from the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Paris-Sud XI, France. I hold a M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science (2011) and B.Tech. Degree in Informatics (2008) from UNICAMP. My research interests include Natural Language Understanding, Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Graphs, Computational Ontologies, Semantic Information Retrieval and Representation, and Human-AI Interaction.
