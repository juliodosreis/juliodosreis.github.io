## Research Impact

- Leadership in ontology engineering and dynamic knowledge graphs, with seminal contributions to ontology alignment, evolution, consistency management, and temporal knowledge graphs, validated through high-impact publications and award-winning research.

- Advancement of neuro-symbolic AI through the integration of Large Language Models and structured knowledge, enabling explainable, robust, and domain-aware systems for question answering, recommendation, and decision support. Knowledge-grounded and explainable AI, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs, retrieval mechanisms, embeddings, and semantic validation.

- Design and orchestration of LLM-based agent and multi-agent architectures, addressing autonomy, coordination, memory, reflection, and human-in-the-loop interaction in complex environments such as education, e-commerce, and industrial monitoring.

- Agentic AI and LLM-based multi-agent systems for autonomous reasoning, reflection, memory, and collaborative task solving across real-world domains.

- Pioneering research in human-centered and socioenactive AI, bridging Human–Computer Interaction, Human–AI Interaction, and participatory design to ensure usability, accessibility, and ethical alignment of intelligent systems.

- Production of impactful research artifacts, including patented software, reusable frameworks, benchmarks, and applied systems, supporting both scientific reproducibility and technology transfer.

- Demonstrated academic, industrial, and societal impact, through the coordination of competitive funded projects, international collaborations, industry partnerships, and the supervision of a large body of M.Sc., P.hD., and postdoctoral researchers.

- Delivering practical solutions in e-commerce, education, and socioenactive human–AI interactions.

## Academic Leadership

- Academic leadership and institutional service, including roles as Director of the Nucleus of Informatics Applied to Education (NIED/UNICAMP), Deputy of the Department of Information Systems, Deputy of the Research Committee at the Institute of Computing contributing to strategic decision-making and academic governance.

- Community building and scientific dissemination, through the organization and co-organization of major national and international conferences and workshops (e.g., AIED, ISWC workshops), strengthening research networks and fostering knowledge exchange.

- Extensive peer-review and evaluation service, acting as reviewer for high-impact international journals and conferences, and serving on numerous program committees, doctoral and master thesis committees, and public academic examinations.

- Graduate and undergraduate research training, with sustained supervision of postdoctoral researchers, Ph.D. and M.Sc. students, undergraduate research projects, and final-year projects, contributing directly to capacity building and researcher formation.

- Curriculum development and teaching innovation, including the creation of new graduate-level courses in Semantic Web and Ontology Engineering, and continuous teaching contributions across undergraduate, graduate, and extension programs.

- Promotion of academia–industry collaboration and technology transfer, through the coordination of funded research projects with industry partners and public agencies, translating academic research into real-world impact while enriching academic research agendas.
