      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce the XX edition of the Workshop-School on Agents, Environments, and Applications (WESAAC), for which I have the honor of serving as General Chair. WESAAC holds a special place in the Brazilian agents community, and this new edition continues its tradition as both a scientific forum and a formative space for researchers at different stages of their academic journey. 
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WESAAC was conceived as more than a conventional workshop. It is also an environment designed to encourage learning, dialogue, and collaboration. Over the years, it has brought together undergraduate students, M.Sc. and Ph.D. candidates, and senior researchers, creating a unique setting where early ideas are welcomed, ongoing projects are refined, and mature research is openly discussed. The program will combine short courses led by experienced researchers with technical sessions featuring full papers, short papers, and demo sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As General Chair, one of my main goals for this edition is to reinforce WESAAC as a space where research-in-progress is valued as much as finalized results. I strongly encourage submissions that reflect different stages of academic work—whether exploratory, theoretical, applied, or interdisciplinary. Sharing challenges, partial results, and lessons learned is essential to building a strong, connected research community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XX WESAAC will take place alongside the 
 in Cuiabá, MT, Brazil, in October 2026, offering participants the opportunity to engage not only with the agent community but also with the broader intelligent systems ecosystem, reinforcing WESAAC&amp;rsquo;s role as a key national forum for multi-agent systems research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working on autonomous agents, multi-agent systems, learning and coordination mechanisms, agent-based simulation, LLM agents, or real-world applications of agent technologies, I warmly invite you to submit your article. Further information on the important dates will be provided as appropriate. Whether this is your first academic contribution or part of a long-term research agenda, WESAAC is a place to exchange ideas, receive constructive feedback, connect with peers who share a passion for agent-based systems, and engage in meaningful discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to welcoming you to this edition of WESAAC and to the conversations, ideas, and collaborations that will emerge from it.&lt;/p&gt;
